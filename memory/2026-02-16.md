## Fixed: Slow Loading Issue
- **Problem**: index.html was loading slowly due to multiple external CDN dependencies and large images
- **Solution**:

  2. Then added back Unsplash professional photos for visual appeal
- **Result**: Page now loads instantly with professional imagery

## Updated: index.html with Professional Photos
